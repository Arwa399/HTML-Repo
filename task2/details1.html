    <h1>Reviews:</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>The film's most iconic scene is purely magical, featuring Princess Anna, magically flies in her most magical summer gown, mimics The Swing paintingâ€™s pose.</li>
    <li>Excellent music numbers including Do You Want to Build a Snowman,  For the First Time in Forever, and Let It Go which won an Academy Award For Best Song, despite it being super annoying.</li>
    <li>Beautifully done animation for the snow and special effects.</li>
    <li>Frozen Is probably one of Disney's best films. Well done with good music, and great art. Why it is more targeted toward girls, boys will still be entertained. I like Olafs character the best. The songs are great. In summer is my favorite. The only song I don't like is love is an open door, because that romance dosent last. But it's a fun film for all ages.</li>
    </ul>
