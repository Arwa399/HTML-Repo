    <ul>
        <li>The animation in Finding Nemo is truly breathtaking. The underwater scenes are stunningly beautiful, and the characters are so well animated that they feel like real, living creatures. The attention to detail in the animation is simply astounding, and it's clear that a lot of love and care went into creating this film.</li>
        <li>Overall, Finding Nemo is a true masterpiece of animation that is sure to stand the test of time. With its stunning visuals, memorable characters, and emotional story, it's a film that everyone should see at least once.</li>
        <li> It's funny, had me in stiches, it did. I can't choose a favourite character, because all of them straight-up rocked! The movie highlights the issue of losing people you love, being differently abled and accepting change...also not being afraid to try new things, all of which I can relate to completely.</li>
        <li>Obviously recommended to everyone who still hasn't watched it (I mean it's 17 years old, go watch it if you haven't already!).</li>
        <li>This is one of the best Pixar films ever made. Besides Toy Story and Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo is the best Pixar movie to me.</li>
