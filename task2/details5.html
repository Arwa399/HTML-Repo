        <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The film's exploration of family dynamics, friendship, and the importance of staying true to oneself resonated deeply with me. I laughed, I cried, and I cheered for Meilin every step of the way. The voice acting was top-notch, and Rosalie Chiang absolutely nailed her role as Meilin.</li>
        <li>Turning Red also boasts gorgeous art direction, which is very colorful, expressive and anime-inspired. Plus Ludwig Göransson's score is a character-driven blend of timely beats and cultural instrumentals (with a touch of magical girl anime). The film is a total feast for the eyes and ears throughout.</li>
        <li>This movie is the cinematic equivalent of an ADHD, Chinese adolescent on just a bit too much caffeine. Nothing overly objectionable, but it makes me want to grab a midol, and I'm a father....</li>
        <li>As a feminist I loved the women empowerment in this film and wish I had a family like there’s. I loved the part when they eat cause I love to eat chase my name is Ruth. </li>
        <li>This film was so powerful in artfully (as well as humorously) talking about mother-daughter intergenerational relationships and the burdens many of us unknowingly carry and try to break from throughout our lives. </li>
