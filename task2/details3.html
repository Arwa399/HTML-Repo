        <li>
            Disney and Pixar crushed it with Inside Out 2 and I am so happy that this movie is doing so well in theaters.  Hopefully they will continue to put out clean movies that are uplifting and family friendly like this movie with great redemptive messages.  Keep it up Disney!!!!</li>
        <li>This movie is indeed a must-watch. Pixar has, once again, excelled in depicting the myriad perspectives of life itself, never failing to enchant and enlighten. Both comedic and emotional timings have elevated the story, bringing balance and depth. Together, they enriched the audience's experience, making it engaging.</li>
        <li>
            The whole story was great and joy I've never seen cry cryed for the first time and finally snapped and... Sweard(mover loving toaster strudel is what she said) and when she did anger smiled which was so funny. I love all the new inventions what had been brought to the movie</li>
        <li>If you want to change your life, a Pixar movie is a pretty good place to start. Highest Recommendation.</li>
        <li>
            All of the characters are completely loveable and are greatly written, especially Anxiety who is voiced by Maya Hawke, I couldn't think of a better choice than her!</li>
