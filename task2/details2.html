        <li>
            The film is equally emotional and funny. I like how they embodied the Mexican tradition, and as a Filipino I have learnt how the same Mexicoâ€™s Dias de los Muertos with our own Undas. </li>
        <li>The film has   a good moral story about family and celebrating those who came before. Furthermore, It teaches you to never give up on your dreams. I highly recommend this film.</li>
        <li>The best movie I have watched to date, including most notable live action music movies like The Blues Brothers. Certainly the best movie from the 21st century I can think of, even beating The Incredibles. </li>
        <li> Disney and Pixar did amazing with this movie. This has to be one of my favourite Disney and Pixar movies. This is why this movie won 11 awards.</li>
        <li>I just really like it and recommend it.</li>
